# Minimal startup configuration - only Supabase connection required
# All other settings (API keys, model choices, RAG flags) are managed via the Settings page

# Get your SUPABASE_URL from the Data API section of your Supabase project settings -
# https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/<your project ID>/settings/api
SUPABASE_URL=

# ⚠️ CRITICAL: You MUST use the SERVICE ROLE key, NOT the Anon key! ⚠️
# 
# COMMON MISTAKE: Using the anon (public) key will cause ALL saves to fail with "permission denied"!
#
# How to get the CORRECT key:
# 1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/<your project ID>/settings/api
# 2. In the Settings menu, click on "API keys" 
# 3. Find "Project API keys" section
# 4. You will see TWO keys - choose carefully:
#    ❌ anon (public): WRONG - This is shorter, starts with "eyJhbGc..." and contains "anon" in the JWT
#    ✅ service_role (secret): CORRECT - This is longer and contains "service_role" in the JWT
#
# The service_role key is typically much longer than the anon key.
# If you see errors like "Failed to save" or "Permission denied", you're using the wrong key!
#
# On the Supabase dashboard, it's labeled as "service_role" under "Project API keys"
